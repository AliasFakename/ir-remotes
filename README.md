# ir-remotes
IR remote config files from lirc - backup of all config and codes

______________________

The purpose of this github is purely to be a backup repository of all the TV remote control codes and configs that can be used in IR blasters or IR apps like irplus. These files can be directly imported into irplus (note that many of these remotes are missing from the irplus library).

My main goal was for the retrogaming community to have these as backups for old CRTs which may not have easy to access remote controls.
